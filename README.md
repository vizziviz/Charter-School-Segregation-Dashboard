# School Segregation Dashboard

Problem: 

Charter schools decrease school segregation in some areas and increase segregation in other areas. Based on controlling (demographic and economic) factors that influence charter school effects and the historical effects of charter schools (if any previously opened in the district), can we predict the segregation effects of opening new charter schools in different school districts?

Steps of Analysis:

1) Conducted analysis of public schools' racial and economic diversity, comparing school populations to district populations by joining Census and public school data

2) Evaluated "segregation index" for each school using a dissimilarity index, a metric that measures how similar the proportions of racial/economic groups in a school are to the proportions of those same groups in a school district

3) Built a Regression Tree predictive model to estimate how much the segregation index with increase or decrease if 1 more charter school were added to the district, using controlling variables to hold constant other demographic and economic characteristics of the districts.

4) Created interactive Tableau Dashboard, allowing users to predict the effects of adding charter schools in a district on district, state, and national-level segregation.
